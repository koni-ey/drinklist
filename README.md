## DEPLOYING AND TESTING:

--> Clone the Repo and navigate to     build/web/    
--> Run a dummy webserver with     "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000"      
--> Open your browser (preferably Chromium based) and go to "http://localhost:8000/#/"

Make sure you configured your endpoint URLs correctly in "lib/api_handler.dart" and potentially rebuild the web build by running "flutter build web" from the root of the repo. 



## TODO:
  - Refactoring and cleanup!!11!1!
  - Admin Menu for adding/removing Drinks/Users and clearing database
